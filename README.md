# Python Database Blog Posts Lab

## Concept

This lab will help you create your own Blog backend! After this lab you will be able to write simple posts and store them in between visits to your blog.

## Objectives

+ Create a blog post database model
+ Make a corresponding frontend that allows users to create posts
+ Show a list of all posts

## Directions

1. Fill in the `Post(ndb.Model)` with a `StringProperty` for a title, a `TextProperty` for the content, and a `DateTimeProperty` that automatically records the date the record was created.
2.


## Stretch

+ Use the Users api to replace the person posting with the signed in Users
+ Make the site look better with CSS and more creative HTML
+ Validate content and user name.
+ Add an email field
